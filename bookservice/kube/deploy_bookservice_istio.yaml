# APP SERVICE

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: bookservice
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 9400 # the service is accesible by the outside world on this port
    protocol: TCP
    #targetPort: 9400 #map the port to the running application port
  selector:
    name: bookapp
  type: ClusterIP 
  #ClusterIP->internal access 
  #NodePort, as the name implies, opens a specific port on all the Nodes any traffic that is sent to this port is forwarded to the service
  #LoadBalancer service is the standard way to expose a service to the internet
  #Ingress is actually NOT a type of service. Instead, it sits in front of multiple services and act as a “smart router” or entrypoint into your cluster
